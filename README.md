**Product Card with Factorial Calculator**
=====================================

**Overview**
------------

This project involves creating a simple, interactive web page with two key components:

1. A visually appealing Product Card.
2. An integrated Factorial Calculator capable of calculating factorials using iterative and recursive methods.

**Key Features**
----------------

### Product Card

* Displays a placeholder product image, name, price, and description.
* Includes an "Add to Cart" button styled for responsiveness and interactivity.

### Factorial Calculator

* Allows users to input a positive integer.
* Calculates the factorial using two methods:
	+ Iterative: Uses a loop to compute the factorial.
	+ Recursive: Uses a recursive function for calculation.
* Displays results along with the calculation method.

**Technology Stack**
--------------------

* HTML: Defines the page structure.
* CSS: Enhances visual styling, ensures responsiveness, and provides a clean interface.
* JavaScript: Implements factorial calculations, input validation, and interactivity.

**Functional Highlights**
-------------------------

### User Interface

* A user-friendly design with clear input fields and buttons.
* Responsive layout suitable for smaller screens.

### Input Validation

* Ensures the input is a valid positive integer.
* Displays error messages for invalid input.

### Result Display

* Shows the computed factorial value.
* Specifies the method (Iterative or Recursive) used for calculation.

**Setup Instructions**
----------------------

1. Save the code into a file named `index.html`.
2. Open the file in any modern web browser.

**Usage Instructions**
----------------------

1. Open the web page in a browser.
2. Use the Product Card for demonstration purposes or interaction.
3. In the Factorial Calculator section:
	* Enter a positive integer.
	* Click "Calculate Iterative" or "Calculate Recursive" to compute the factorial.
4. The result will display below the input field, including the calculation method.

**Additional Notes**
--------------------

* The web page includes responsive design and ensures compatibility with different devices and browsers.
* The background image provides a visually appealing touch, enhancing user experience.

**Future Enhancements**
----------------------

* Adding animations to buttons and the factorial results.
* Introducing a modal for the factorial calculator for better separation from the product card.
